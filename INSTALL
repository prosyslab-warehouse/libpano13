# CMake based build system

The file contains instructions to build libpano13 with CMake.

1. DEPENDENCIES

libpano13 depends on the following packages:

    libjpeg
    libtiff
    libpng
    zlib
    suitesparse (optional)

To compile, cmake and a C compiler such as gcc are required

2. COMPILING

First, create a build directory and change into it:

    mkdir BUILD
    cd BUILD

Configure, compile and install:

    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install

Optionally create a distributable archive package:

    make package_source

The build process can be configured with different switches. These variables
can be set with the -D command line parameter. Important variables include:

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX   Destination directory of make install
                       (default: /usr/local)

CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE       Specify the build type (Release (Default) or Debug)

LIB_SUFFIX             Specifies suffix used for library paths. For AMD64,
                       usually 64 is used as prefix. Default: empty.
                       Setting to 64 results in: $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib64

SUPPORT_JAVA_PROGRAMS  Compile with Java API (default: OFF)

USE_SPARSE_LEVMAR      Compile with SuiteSparse optimisation (default: OFF)


CMake offers also a ccmake TUI which makes setting these variables and checking
the paths to the dependencies easier.
