	* I forgot that OS X is case insensitive (even though it is case
	preserving). I have renamed ptmender.h to PTmender.h. Updated
	Makefile.am and PTmender.c (thanks to Bruno Postle for noticing
	this).
	
	* PTmender.c (CreatePanorama): Fixed some bugs during code review
	of CreatePanorama
	(CreatePanorama): Changed name of Unknown28 to Colour_Brightness

	* README.PTmender: Added an explanation of its command line options.

	* PTmender.c (main): Completed main.
	(sorting_function): Added it to sort files if -s

	* README.PTmender: Added this file.

	* PTmender.c, PTmender.h: I created these two files. Created the
	functions ReplaceExt, InsertFileName, and CreatePanorama. It has
	also all the skeletons to all the functions that need to be
	rewritten.

	* Modified Makefile.am to add PTmender. The program currently
	compiles, but does nothing. 

	* Created the ChangeLog.
