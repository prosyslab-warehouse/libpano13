2006-01-15  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* ColourBrightness.c: Removed useless comments.
	
	* ColourBrightness.c (Unknown49): Fixed a bug. Unknown49 is
	identical to Unknown48, not itself!
	

	* PTmender.c (CreatePanorama): Found a bug. A strcmp did not
	include ==0.
	(ComputeStitchingMask8bits): Implemented function.
	(CalculateAlphaChannel): Implemented function.
	(SetBestAlphaChannel8bits): Implemented function.
	(CreateStitchingMasks): Found an error: Progress returns zero
	when not error, not !=0. Also, I forgot return -1
	(ApplyFeather): Implemented function.
	(SetBestAlphaChannel8bits): Fixed a bug in the function. Wrong
	condition in loop.
	(PT_MENDER_VERSION):  Bumped version to 0.3 "The Mask". Released.

2006-01-14  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTmender.c (CreatePSD): Implemented function.
	(TiffSetImageParameters): Added function.
	(CreateStitchingMasks): Implemented function.
	(ComputeStitchingMask): Implemented function.

2006-01-12  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* ColourBrightness.c: Remove fprintfs

	* PTmender.c: Enabled colour correction. Ready for
	testing. Upgraded version to 0.2: "the Enlightment"

	* ColourBrightness.c (Unknown40): Fixed another bug. This time it
	was the data type of a variable. It was double, not integer!

2006-01-12  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTmender.c (CreatePanorama): Reduced the size of the cache to
	500kbytes

	* ColourBrightness.c: Improved readibility of many functions.
	(RemapHistogram): Another bug. Divided a/b
	instead of b/a.

2006-01-11  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* ColourBrightness.c: (ComputeColourBrightnessCorrection) Found
	another bug (limit of for loop was < 0xff not <= 0xff).
	(ComputeColourBrightnessCorrection): Cleaned up the function,
	renamed variables to make them meaninful. Killed another
	bug. Again, a/b instead of b/a
	(CorrectFileColourBrightness): Another bug. Missundertood return
	value from readTIFF: it is zero when success, -1 when it is not.
	(CorrectImageColourBrigthness): Another bug. im->data is a pointer
	to the pointer to the actual data, not a pointer to the data!
	Took advante of the editing and cleaned up the code and renamed
	some veriables.
	(DisplayHistogramsError): Refactored this function from
	ColourBrightness.

	* ColourBrightness.h, ColourBrightness.c: Renamed Unknown41 to
	ComputeAdjustmentCurve. Renamed Unknown37 to RemapHistogram. I
	have added assertions and debug code everywhere. Renamed Unknown33
	to MapFunction. Updated callers accordingly.
	
2006-01-10  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* ColourBrightness.c: (ComputeColourBrightnessCorrection): Another
	bug: incorrect number of daisies.
	
2006-01-10  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* ColourBrightness.c: I changed all mallocs to callocs. I also
	added and removed some debug messages, and added optional use of
	the dmalloc library.
	(InitializeMagnolia): fixed a bug. I had allocated sizeof(pointer)
	rather than sizeof(thing pointed by pointer). What an amateur!
	(ColourBrightness): Another bug, I was freeing an incorrect number
	of histograms.
	(Unknown33): Fixed another bug. I referenced last element as
	array[n] instead of the correct way array[n-1].
	(Unknown37): Another bug 2 bugs. I had missed a set of parenthesis
	in an expression. The next line had a couple of errors too.
	(FreeHistograms): Another bug. One free  was in the wrong place.

	* README.PTmender: Updated it.

	* PTmender.c (CreatePanorama): Disabled code for colour correction.

	* Makefile.am (AM_CPPFLAGS): Added flags for TIFF and JPEG to the
	compilation of the programs.


2006-01-09  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTmender.c (CreatePanorama): Fixed a bug that affected cropped
	images. I think TIFF_m is ready for the masses. The tests I have
	performed are promising.
	(main): Added a Version message for its official release. Initial
	release: 0.1

	* ColorBrightness.c, ColorBrightness.h: First bug: I got burned by
	the fact that chars are by default signed. I changed any use of
	char to unsigned.
	
2006-01-09  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* Makefile.am (PTmender_SOURCES): Added colourBrightness.* to PTmender

	* PTmender.c: Renamed CreatePanorama, removed old function stub

	* ColorBrightness.c, ColorBrightness.h: added files. All the
	functions for colourBrightness have been created, but they do not
	work.

2006-01-04  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTmender.c (main): Fixed another bug, in the case that no files
	were specified in the command line.
	(ARGtoRGBAImage): Fixed another bug (a line I duplicated, but that
	I did not update).
	(CreatePanorama): Replaced assertion on colourCorreection. I had
	misinterpreted what the value was.

2005-12-25  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTmender.c (main,CreatePanorama): Fixed 5 more bugs. I am able
	to stitch the first one photo panorama! 

2005-12-24  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* Makefile.am: Removed -Wall from make process

	* PTmender.c (main): Fixed 3 bugs.
	(CreatePanorama): Fixed 2 bugs

2005-12-23  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTmender.c (CreatePanorama): It appears now to be complete. We
	have all the code for TIFF_m without brightness adjustment. Time
	to start planning the testing phase.
	
	* PTmender.c (main): First bug: getopt should be used instead of
	iloopCounter

2005-12-22  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTmender.h: Renamed Unknown09 to
	Clear_Area_Outside_Selected_Region

	* PTmender.c (Clear_Area_Outside_Selected_Region): Created
	function. This completes all the functions needed for
	TIFF_m. 

2005-12-21  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTmender.h (InsertFileName): added prototype.

	* Makefile.am (PTmender_LDADD): We now require the tiff library too.
	(AM_CFLAGS): Added -Wall. I need to catch _any_ potential error.

	* PTmender.c, PTmender.h (ARGtoRGBAImage): Renamed Unknown08 to
	ARGtoRGBAImage and implemented it.

	* I forgot that OS X is case insensitive (even though it is case
	preserving). I have renamed ptmender.h to PTmender.h. Updated
	Makefile.am and PTmender.c (thanks to Bruno Postle for noticing
	this).
	
	* PTmender.c (CreatePanorama): Fixed some bugs during code review
	of CreatePanorama
	(CreatePanorama): Changed name of Unknown28 to Colour_Brightness

	* README.PTmender: Added an explanation of its command line options.

	* PTmender.c (main): Completed main.
	(sorting_function): Added it to sort files if -s

2005-12-20  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* README.PTmender: Added this file.

	* PTmender.c, PTmender.h: I created these two files. Created the
	functions ReplaceExt, InsertFileName, and CreatePanorama. It has
	also all the skeletons to all the functions that need to be
	rewritten.

	* Modified Makefile.am to add PTmender. The program currently
	compiles, but does nothing. 

	* Created the ChangeLog.
