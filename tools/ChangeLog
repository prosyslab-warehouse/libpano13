	* README.PTmender: Added this file.

	* PTmender.c, PTmender.h: I created these two files. Created the
	functions ReplaceExt, InsertFileName, and CreatePanorama. It has
	also all the skeletons to all the functions that need to be
	rewritten.

	* Modified Makefile.am to add PTStitcher. The program currently
	compiles, but does nothing. 

	* Created the ChangeLog.
