This file documents the activities required before we release version
3.0.0 of the library.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
PTremap:
 
DESIRABLE FEATURES:
 
 - Output a text file with the names of the files processed and extra
   information, such as size

 - Process fisheye lenses.
 
 - If somebody wants full compatibility with PTstitcher, a new program
   can be added that does all the work. It will be a "superset" of many
   of the current pano tools.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PTblender:

DESIRABLE:
 
 - (PTblender) Create photoshop curves and maps for HSV colour
   corrections. Probably not for 3.0.0
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PTroller:
 

- Split PTroller into 2: PTmasker and PTroller
  
DESIRABLE:

- PTroller: Add the ability to stack and add composing images.

 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 PTuncrop:
 
* Ready for 3.0.0

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
PTtiff2psd:
 
- One layer 8 and 16 bit images are not being properly created. 


 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
PToptimizer:

* Ready for 3.0.0
 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 DESIRABLE new tools:
 
 PTcrop:
 
 - Two options: crop to bounding rectangle, and crop to inner rectangle
   (I think that were the names Pablo gave them).
 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL

 - Add support for images without full size tags --this will affect all
   panotools) and make sure all tools are compatible with TIFFs output
   by nona and fulla.


 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 LONGER TERM:
 
 * Allow tools to read their parameters from the PTstitcher script.
 
 * Add support to all the tools for 16 bit, and 32 bit images (it is
   kind of mixed at this point)
