This file documents the activities required before we release version
3.0.0 of the library.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
PTmap:
 
PTmap should be a lightweight, simple stitching program and nothing
else. That means it will only do mapping of the panoramas. In terms of
the old PTsticher scripts it means it will only create TIFF_m,
cropped, no colour correction. It will be up to the caller application
to take these files and create the desired output (apply colour
correction, cropping, uncropping, conversion to other formats).
 
This will simplify testing, and improve stability.
 
 
TODO:
  
 - Rename PTmender to PTremap
 
DESIRABLE FEATURES:
 
 - Insert script into the TIFF comment field.
 
 - Cleanup command line options, and add a -h option
 
 - Process fisheye lenses.
 
 - If somebody wants full compatibility with PTstitcher, a new program
   can be added that does all the work. It will be a "superset" of many
   of the current pano tools.
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 PTblender:
 
 It will split into 2 programs:
 
 - PTblender. It will do colour correction _only_. 
 
 - PTroller.  It will flatten an image. It will take a set of TIFFs and
   create only one TIFF
 
 DESIRABLE:
 
 - (PTblender) Create photoshop curves and maps for HSV colour
   corrections
 
 - (PTblender) Ignore areas with mask != 255 during computation of the
   curves, but transform them if mask > 0
 
 - (PTroller) Add the ability to stack and add composing images.
  
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 PTuncrop:
 
 - No major changes, except that it will support images without full
   size tags.
 
 TODO:
 
 - Add support for images without full size tags --this will affect all
   panotools) and make sure all tools are compatible with TIFFs output
   by nona and fulla.
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 PTtiff2psd:
 
 TODO:
 
 - Nothing
 
 DESIRABLE:
 
 - Specify blending mode for layers
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 PTestimate (old PToptimizer)
 
 TODO:
 
 - Nothing
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 DESIRABLE new tools:
 
 PTcrop:
 
 - Two options: crop to bounding rectangle, and crop to inner rectangle
   (I think that were the names Pablo gave them).
 
 
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 LONGER TERM:
 
 * Allow tools to read their parameters from the PTstitcher script.
 
 * Add support to all the tools for 16 bit, and 32 bit images (it is
   kind of mixed at this point)
