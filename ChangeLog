2006-06-12  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTcommon.c (ReplaceAlphaChannel): The images created in this
	routine were not labeled as cropped. This patch fixes the
	problem. The test case did not catch this problem. We need a
	360/180 one.

2006-06-11  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTcommon.c: Improved the behaviour during errors. exit(-1) if
	there is an irrecoverable error.

2006-06-11    <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTcommon.c (CreatePanorama): Change extension of generated PSD
	from .PSD to .psd. Remove a temp file that was left in the cropped processing.
	
2006-06-11  Max Lyons <maxlyons@tawbaware.com>

	* ColourBrightness.c, PTcommon.c, tiff.c, filter.h, pttiff.h, 
	libpano12.def, pano12.def.  Changes to support "cropped tiff" processing 
	when using colour/brightness correction in PTMender.  Changes also allow 
	pttiff2psd to work with cropped tiff output as well.


2006-06-04  Pablo d'Angelo <pablo.dangelo@web.de>

	* ptpicker.c, PTcommon.c: Moved InsertFileName from ptpicker.c to
	PTcommon.c. This broke compilation of PTmender, when java support
	was disabled.

2006-06-04  Max Lyons <maxlyons@tawbaware.com>

	* PTMender.c: Changed behavior for input file name parsing.  If the script 
	is specified on the command line with a path (e.g. c:\some\path\myscript.txt), 
	this path was prepended to all of the image names in the script, regardless 
	of whether those image names were also specified with a full qualified path.  
	This change adds a check so that the script path is only prepended to the 
	image names if the image names don't already contain path information.

	* PTCommon.c: Fixing bug with morph-to-fit.  Memory allocated with malloc 
	was being incorrectly freed with myfree leading to random crashes.
	
2006-05-31  Max Lyons <maxlyons@tawbaware.com>

	* PTCommon.c: Fixed bug in getROI

2006-05-29  Max Lyons <maxlyons@tawbaware.com>

	* adjust.c: CheckParams: Allowing optimizer to work with new projections

	* Moving uncrop logic from ptuncrop.c to ptcommon.c.  Creating 
	uncropTiff function
	
	* Adding uncropTiff function declaration to pttiff.h
	
	* Making cropped TIFF the intermediate format for all processing, 
	regardless of output format.  Uncropped TIFFs can be generated, if needed, 
	from intermediate cropped TIFFs by calling new uncropTiff function.

2006-05-29  Max Lyons <maxlyons@tawbaware.com>

	Changes fix various compilation problems:

	* Moved declaration of three functions from ptcommon.h to new ptttiff.h file.  
	
	* Updated includes in PTcommon.c and PTuncrop.c
	
	* Updated pano12.def and libpano12.def to  include the same, latest, exports

2006-05-27  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTcommon.c (CreatePanorama): Removed some ugly formatting I
	introduced in a recent commit
	(CreatePanorama): Fixed bug of the missing column/row introduced
	in cropped files.
	
	* PTcommon.h (TiffSetImageParameters,TiffGetImageParameters):
	Exported  these functions to be able to use them in
	PTuncrop. Added #include <tiffio.h>

2006-05-24  Max Lyons <maxlyons@tawbaware.com>

	* PTCommon.c: All logic has been reworked so that "cropped"
	TIFF files can be used throughout the stitching process for all currently 
	supported output formats.  (Cropped TIFF files are those that are just 
	large enough to contain	the remapped image, and the offset/full size 
	information is stored in the TIFF header).  Modified functions include 
	ReplaceAlphaChannel, CreateAlphaChannels, AddStitchingMasks, FlattenTIFF, 
	createPanorama.  New functions include getCropInformationFromTiff, 
	setFullSizeImageParameters.
	
	* PTCommon.c: Simplified ComputeStitchingMask8bits syntax
	
	* PTCommon.c: CreatePanorama.  Reworked logic to handle intermediate output files
	and produce final output in various formats.  Added logic that decides when
	to use cropped TIFF as intermediate format based on chosen output format.  TODO:
	this could use some tidy up, and it might be a good idea to have cropped TIFF
	as the default intermediate format for TIFF_m and TIFF_mask, and include a 
	function to "expand" the cropped TIFFs to full size when finished (if the 
	user requests non-cropped TIFF).
	
	* PTCommon.c: Reluctantly commented out calls to TIFFSetWarningHandler and 
    TIFFSetErrorHandler...these cause to GCC to abort, with a series of errors 
    about multiple definition of TIFF functions in libpano and libtiff.  
    
    * PTCommon.c: Changed title bar of progress dialog to indicate currently 
    processing image number (indexed at 1) and total images to be processed.
	
	* ColourBrightness.c, PTMender.c : changed #include syntax
	
	* file.c: writePSD, writeLayerAndMask, writeChannelData, getImageRectangle, 
	addLayer.  Reworked to handle "cropped" files.
	
	* filter.h: getCropInformation. Adding declaration.
	
	* tiff.c: readTIFF.  Storing filename of TIFF in im->name.
	
	* panorama.h: Adding CropInfo struct...used for processed cropped images

	* pt_stdint.h: Fixing bad CR/LF combinations
        	

2006-05-24  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTcommon.c (TiffSetImageParameters, TiffGetImageParameters):
	Make sure ROWSPERSTRIP is propagated.

2006-05-23  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTcommon.c (TiffGetImageParameters, TiffSetImageParameters):
	Make sure compression is propagated at further stages
	(CreatePanorama): Implemented support for C:NONE 
	(CreatePanorama): Implemented support for C:DEFLATE 
	(ComputeStitchingMask8bits): Removed redundant code.

2006-05-22  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTcommon.c: Checked return value of each TIFFWriteScanline. It
	now returns an error when it cannot write to the output (instead of
	just continue blindly). Added Error and Warning handler for TIFF
	library so the errors are now reported using the PTtools error
	handler.
	(CreatePSD): Make sure PSD is 8 bit if it contains more than 1
	layer (we do not support multi-layer 16bit images). Cleaned up the
	function and added some comments.
	(ComputeStitchingMask8bits): Cleanedup the function (still more
	work to do)

2006-05-20  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTcommon.c (CreatePanorama): Fixed a bug in TIFF_mask (the
	program was not ending after where it should have)

2006-05-15  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTcommon.c (CreatePanorama): Fixed a typo related to QTVR
	images. I also renamed Unknown07 to Create_QTVR

	* resample.c: Fixed compilation warnings by moving #define
	unsigned inside the body of the functions.

2006-05-16 Max Lyons (maxlyons@tawbaware.com)

	* resample.c: Fixing bug in fast transform logic that caused crash when 
	destRect.left != 0 (i.e. producing cropped TIFF output)

2006-05-15 Max Lyons (maxlyons@tawbaware.com)

	* Removed old versions of ptcommon and colourbrightness from the 
	tools...these had already been moved into libpano main directory

	* Updated Makefile.win32 to include missing references to sys_common.c, 
	PTCommon.c, hdrfile.c, rgbe.c, ColourBrightness.c...should now build 
	correctly using MingW

	* pano12.def: Removed duplicate entry for "StringtoFullPath" 
	(exported twice).

	* PTcommon.c: Changed #include <filter.h> to #include "filter.h" (this 
	prevented compilation with MingW)

	* PTcommon.c: Changed call to execute_stack to execute_stack_new (necessary 
	as a result of modification to Transformation function type)

	* PTcommon.c: Removed InsertFileName definition.  This is already defined 
	in PTPicker, and prevented compilation with MingW.

	* ColourBrightness.c: Changed #include <filter.h> to #include "filter.h" 
	(this prevented compilation with MingW)

	* PTBlender: Fixed comparison between pointer and integer error (line 102)

2006-05-07  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	(ComputeColourBrightnessCorrection): Cleaned up the function,
	renamed variables to make them meaninful. Killed another
	bug. Again, a/b instead of b/a (CorrectFileColourBrightness):
	Another bug. Missundertood return value from readTIFF: it is zero
	when success, -1 when it is not.  (CorrectImageColourBrigthness):
	Another bug. im->data is a pointer to the pointer to the
	actual data, not a pointer to the data!  Took advante of the
	editing and cleaned up the code and renamed some veriables.
	(DisplayHistogramsError): Refactored this function from
	ColourBrightness.

	* ColourBrightness.h, ColourBrightness.c: Renamed Unknown41 to

	by pointer). What an amateur!  (ColourBrightness): Another bug,
	I was freeing an incorrect number of histograms.  (Unknown33):
	Fixed another bug. I referenced last element as array[n] instead
	of the correct way array[n-1].	(Unknown37): Another bug 2 bugs. I
