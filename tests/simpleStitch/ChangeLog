	* Makefile.am (all): Undo the changes below... I decided instead
	to remove the test directory from the make in the root
	directory. Too bad CVS does not support transactions and rollbacks.

	* README.txt: run "make test" to, you got it, run the test

	* Makefile.am (all): Removed test from default Make.
